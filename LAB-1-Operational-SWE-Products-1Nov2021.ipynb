    "# Operational Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) Products \n",
    "In this lab we will explore two operational SWE products to estimate basin wide SWE. These are standard products, produced in near real time (NRT), that are publically avalible. A word of caution: as you might remember from the lectures, estimating SWE in the mountains is hard. Operational SWE products perform better in large, flat areas with consisten depth and densisty of snowpack across many square kilometeres. Fortunatly, ongoing development of these products means they are continuously improving. While these products might not produce completely accurate basin scale SWE, they can often be used as an index along with data from previous years. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Two types of SWE products: Measurements and Models\n",
    "There are two main catagories of operational SWE products: remotely sensed measurements of SWE and process based model estimates of SWE. We will explore an example of both. For measurement of SWE, we will look at data from the unified Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) SWE products which provide daily estimates of global SWE. Note that the product may not be available in some mountainous regions. For process based Model estimates of SWE we will explore the newest near real-time (NRT) ECWMF Re-analysis (ERA-5) SWE estimates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Goals of the lab:\n",
    "- Gain familiarity with SWE plots\n",
    "- Understand the two main sources of SWE estimates: remotely sensed measurements and process based models\n",
    "- Gain familiarty with interpolation and smoothing of data\n",
    "- Data science techniques to visualize the SWE in the context of historical records"

    "The first product we are going to look at is the AMSR Unifed SWE product. These data are collected from satellites that measure the emission of microwave radiation from Earth. Snow scatters and absorbs the microwave radiation.  Based on the measured reduction in passive microwave signal, we can estimate the snow water equivalent. This method works best in areas that have shallow snowpack, are devoid of forests, and are flat for at least 25 kilometers.\n",
